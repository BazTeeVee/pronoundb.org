# Contribution Guidelines
Thanks for your interest in contributing! First, make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb.org/blob/mistress/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of the project.

## Issues

 - Post unnecessary comments such as "+1". Prefer using a reaction instead
 - Speak in the name of the project maintainers

### Avoid
 - Making issues simply to say thanks or that the project is amazing. While I love to see it and am really thankful
 for the attention, issues aren't the ideal place for it. Shoot me an email at cynthia@cynthia.dev instead! <3

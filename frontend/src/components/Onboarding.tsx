      <p>
        Thanks for installing the extension. You'll finally no longer have to go through the trouble of reminding
        pronouns for every single person you see on the Internet!
      </p>
      <h3>Share your own pronouns</h3>
      <p>
        You can let other people know your pronouns by {how}, configuring your pronouns and linking your accounts. They
        will instantly see your pronouns show up on the accounts you linked. You can link multiple accounts per
        platform, if you're into that kind of things!
      </p>
      <h3>Feeling generous?</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish, you can <a href={Routes.DONATE} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>donate</a>, so I can keep buying
        enough cookies and coffee to stay alive! ðŸ¥°
      </p>
